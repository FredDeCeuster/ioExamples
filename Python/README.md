# Python IO
---

I can highly recommend Anaconda when using Python. The `h5py` module for HDF5 comes standard with Anaconda, the `vtk` module has to be installed separately. This can be done using conda.
```
$ conda install -c anaconda vtk
```
When installing vtk in this way you should not have to alter your `PYTHONPATH` (if you did it can mess things up).

There are many other and better examples! This is just for myself, or for you if you like it...
Please open an issue if I got anything wrong.
